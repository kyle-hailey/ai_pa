Based on your YugabyteDB query optimization context, we can propose the following optimizations with respective trade-offs:

Solution 1:

Add a secondary ascending index on the 'id' field. It will allow for efficient range queries even for hash-partitioned tables.

```sql
CREATE INDEX id_range_idx ON hash_vs_range (id ASC);
```

Trade-offs: Although range and ORDER BY queries will be more efficient, maintaining secondary indexes may affect the performance of DML operations and could lead to write hotspots for monotonically increasing columns.

Solution 2:

Recreate the table using RANGE partitioning. This will enable the database to store data in key order, making range queries and ORDER BY clauses much more efficient.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hash_vs_range (
   id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
   car varchar,
   speed int,
   ts timestamp,
   PRIMARY KEY(id ASC)
) SPLIT INTO 3 TABLETS;
```

Trade-offs: Although range and ORDER BY queries will be more efficient without maintaining secondary indexes, this solution requires recreating and reloading the table which can be challenging for larger tables. Write hotspots can occur if records are inserted sequentially.

Solution 3:

Add a virtual bucketing column to the secondary index. This will help distribute inserts across multiple tablets, reducing hotspots.

```SQL
CREATE INDEX id_range_bucketed_idx ON hash_vs_range ((yb_hash_code(id) % 3) ASC, id);
```

Queries with Order By need to be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE (yb_hash_code(id) % 3) = 0 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE (yb_hash_code(id) % 3) = 1 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE (yb_hash_code(id) % 3) = 2 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3)
) AS combined
ORDER BY id ASC
LIMIT 3;
```

Trade-offs: Although this method reduces hotspots and makes range and ORDER BY queries more efficient, there is an overhead of maintaining secondary index and you need to rewrite SQL for queries using ORDER BY to benefit from the bucketed index.

Solution 4:

Repartition the base table with a bucket ID. This allows the partitions to be distributed across multiple tablets reducing hotspots.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hash_vs_range (
   id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
   car varchar,
   speed int,
   ts timestamp,
   bucketid smallint DEFAULT (random()::smallint % 3),
   PRIMARY KEY(bucketid ASC, id ASC)
);
```

Queries with Order By need to be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE bucketid = 0 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE bucketid = 1 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE bucketid = 2 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3)
) AS combined
ORDER BY id ASC
LIMIT 3;
```

Trade-offs: This eliminates the need for secondary indexes, but the table needs to be fully rebuilt and reloaded which can be operationally challenging for larger tables. Also, queries with Order By need rewriting. 

In summary, each solution has its trade-offs, secondary indexes provide a relatively straightforward improvement, but they also have overheads and can be subject to hotspots. Changing table schema or re-organising data can offer greater efficiency improvements but will likely require more substantial changes and could be operationally disruptive.
