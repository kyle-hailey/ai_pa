The given SQL query is:
```
select * from hash_vs_range where id > 1 and id < 4;
```
This query is a range query which is performing a scan on the 'hash_vs_range' table where primary key is 'id'. Since this table is HASH partitioned, the above range query will lead to full table scans across all the tablets, resulting in sub-optimal performance.

Solution 1: Add Secondary ASC Index:
```
CREATE INDEX hash_vs_range_idx ON hash_vs_range (id ASC);
```
This approach will create an index on 'id' in ascending order, which will make range scans more efficient.

Pros:
- The range queries and ORDER BY clauses will be faster without requiring query rewrites.
Cons:
- Adds overhead for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands as these should now maintain the index.
- Potential write hotspots if 'id' column values are monotonically increasing.

Solution 2: Modify The Table to Range Partitioned:
```
CREATE TABLE hash_vs_range (
   id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
   car varchar,
   speed int,
   ts timestamp,
   PRIMARY KEY(id ASC)
) SPLIT INTO 3 TABLETS;
```
This table is now created to be range partitioned, making range queries and order by operations more efficient.

Pros:
- Supports range and order by queries transparently without requiring secondary indexes.
Cons:
- Recreating the table might be challenging for large tables or tables that are heavily used.
- If the indexed column has a monotonically increasing pattern, write hotspots may occur.

Solution 3: Secondary Index with Bucket ID
```
CREATE INDEX hash_vs_range_bucket_idx ON hash_vs_range ((yb_hash_code(id) % 3) ASC, id ASC);
```
This solution helps to spread inserts across different buckets, reducing potential write hotspots. However, for ORDER BY queries, each bucket must be individually queried with 'UNION ALL'.

Pros:
- Balances the data distribution on the secondary index.
Cons:
- Adds overhead for maintaining a secondary index.
- Order by queries need to be rewritten to take advantage of this structure.

Order By Rewrite Example:
```
SELECT * FROM (
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE (yb_hash_code(id) % 3) = 0 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE (yb_hash_code(id) % 3) = 1 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE (yb_hash_code(id) % 3) = 2 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3)
) AS combined ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3;
```

Solution 4: Modifying the table schema to use bucket_id:
```
CREATE TABLE hash_vs_range (
   id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
   car varchar,
   speed int,
   ts timestamp,
   bucket_id smallint DEFAULT (random()::smallint % 3),
   PRIMARY KEY(bucket_id ASC, id ASC)
) SPLIT INTO 3 TABLETS;
```
This approach helps to remove the need for secondary index for data distribution.

Pros:
- Removes the need for maintaining a secondary index.
Cons:
- Requires a full table rebuild, which may not be practical for large production systems.

Order By Rewrite with UNION ALL and bucket_id:
```
SELECT * FROM (
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE bucket_id = 0 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE bucket_id = 1 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM hash_vs_range WHERE bucket_id = 2 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3)
) AS combined ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 3;
```

These are the possible optimizations for the provided SQL query and their respective pros and cons. The final decision should be made based on additional factors such as your workload, data distribution, and infrastructure.
