YugabyteDB Query Optimization Report:

Initial Query: 
```sql
select * from hash_vs_range where id > 1 and id < 4;
```

YugabyteDB Partitioning Model:
- YugabyteDB partitions tables into tablets.
- By default, primary keys are HASH partitioned across tablets. This ensures even data distribution but makes range queries inefficient.
- RANGE partitioning improves the efficiency of range queries but might lead to write hotspots if inserts are sequential (for example, timestamps, IDs).

Four solutions are proposed to optimize the query performance:

1. Add a Secondary ASC Index on the "id" column:
```sql
CREATE INDEX id_asc_index ON hash_vs_range (id ASC);
```
This solution can transparently address the range query by creating a secondary index in ascending order.
  - Pros: Transparent to most queries without needing query rewrites.
  - Cons: Additional write overhead and potential write hotspots.

2. Recreate the table changing from hash partitioning to range partitioning on the "id" column:
```sql
CREATE TABLE hash_vs_range (
   id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
   car varchar,
   speed int,
   ts timestamp,
   PRIMARY KEY(id ASC)
) SPLIT INTO 3 TABLETS;
```
This solution improves range queries efficiency at the cost of hotspot risk in data write.
  - Pros: Supports range queries transparently and avoids secondary index maintenance.
  - Cons: Operational complexity in re-creating the table and potential write hotspots.

3. Create a secondary index with a virtual bucketing column:
```sql
CREATE INDEX id_bucket_index ON hash_vs_range ((yb_hash_code(id) % 3) ASC, id ASC);
```
The virtual bucketing column ("yb_hash_code(id) % 3") helps distribute inserts across multiple buckets, reducing hotspots.
  - Pros: Spreads inserts across multiple buckets, reducing hotspots.
  - Cons: Additional overhead for maintaining the secondary index and a necessity to rewrite SQL using order by.

4. Repartition the base table by adding "bucket_id" directly to the primary key:
```sql
CREATE TABLE hash_vs_range (
   id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
   car varchar,
   speed int,
   ts timestamp,
   bucketid smallint DEFAULT (random()::smallint % 3),
   PRIMARY KEY(bucketid ASC, id ASC)
) SPLIT INTO 3 TABLETS;
```
This is a modification of the table, adding a computed bucket id to avoid hotspots in the data, while the table is being rebuilt and reloaded.
  - Pros: Removes the need for secondary indexes entirely.
  - Cons: Table reconstruction which can be operationally challenging for large tables or systems requiring continuous uptime.

Trade-off Summary:
- Secondary indexes are easy to implement and transparent to application code but might impact write performance..
- Bucket-based designs reduce hotspots but require more complex query rewrites for ORDER BY.
- Repartitioning tables may offer optimal performance but requires table rebuilds, which may not be practical for large production systems.
